    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>500 g of pork</li>
        <li>250 g of beef</li>
        <li>200 g of dry pork ribs</li>
        <li>150 g of dry bacon</li>
        <li>150 g of fat</li>
        <li>50 g of rice</li>
        <li>2 kg of sauerkraut</li>
        <li>2 bay leaves</li>
        <li>1 egg</li>
        <li>1 spoon of flour</li>
        <li>1 head of onion</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon of allspice</li>
        <li>a little pepper</li>
        <li>salt</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Remove one leaf at a time from the smaller heads of sauerkraut,
         cut off the thicker ribs with a knife and wash them well in cold water.</li>
        <li>Clean the meat from veins and grind. Put 100g of fat, minced meat and chopped onion in a frying pan, then fry a little.
        Add rice, a little ground pepper, one egg and salt to taste, then mix everything well.</li>
        <li>Arrange several cabbage leaves on the bottom of a large pot.
            Take, one by one, a leaf of cabbage, put a spoonful of meat filling on each one and roll the leaves into small tight rolls.
            Tuck the ends of the cabbage well, so that the filling does not fall out during cooking. Arrange the sarma in the pan, one next to the other, in several rows.
            Wash the dry meat and bacon in hot water, cut into pieces, and place between the rows of sarma.
            Add 5-6 peppercorns and 2 laurel leaves. Pour cold water over the sarma and cook on low heat for about 3-4 hours.
            In a pan, make a paste of 50g of fat, a spoonful of flour and a teaspoon of allspice, pour it over the sarma, cover the pan and leave it to boil for another half hour. Instead of bread with sarma, proja is served.</li>
