    <h2>Description</h2>

    <p>Proja is a traditional Serbian cornbread made with a combination of cornmeal, salt, and water. </p>
    <p>As soon as milk, beaten eggs, and butter or oil are added to this peasant dish, it's no longer a cornbread but a savory pie called projara, projanica, razlevak, or muruzara, depending on which part of Serbia you find yourself in.</p>
