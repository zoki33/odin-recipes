    <h2>Description</h2>

    <p>Recently, I watched a program on television about food in Herzegovina, which included a presnac. I didn't write down the ingredients and quantities, because when I realized that it could be a very good pie as a savory appetizer or dessert, the ingredients disappeared from the screen.</p>
    <p>TSo I started making it from memory, and I tried the quantity. Already for the first time I got an excellent taste. And then I added a little cream and it really turned out to be a wonderful salty pie (can be without cream).</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2 large cups (for white coffee) of flour</li>
        <li>1.5 cups of milk</li>
        <li>Salt</li>
        <li>4 eggs</li>
        <li>0.5 dl of oil or fat</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Grease the pan with grease and heat it in the oven at 220 degrees.</li>
        <li>Beat eggs, milk and flour, salt, the mixture should be thicker than for pancakes.</li>
        <li>Pour over the hot fat in the pan. Bake until the dough is golden brown.</li>
        <li>Put the dough into cubes and pour over the dressing.</li>
        <li>Return to the oven and bake for another 5-10 minutes.</li>
        <li><em></em>You can also add 200 g of fresh cream to the sour cream and sour milk.</li>

    </ol>
